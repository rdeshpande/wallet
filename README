Install using ./install.sh

# IRC

Create a .irssi.private file with something like the following:

servers = (
  {
    address = "irc.freenode.org";
    chatnet = "freenode";
    password = "mypassword";
    port = "8001";
    autoconnect = "true";
  }
);

== ZSH

The shell in this package requires oh-my-zsh. The install.sh has been updated to set this up.
